# Deploy a Sentiment Analysis Model
*Udacity - Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program*

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build and deploy a Sentiment Analysis model using Amazon's SageMaker platform in order
to determine the sentiment of a movie review. The model is a recurrent neural network using LSTM gates that was trained
on the IMDB data set.

## Software and Libraries

This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-364/)
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
* [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/)
